## Usage/info

### Slides

The slides were created with PowerPoint 2016 and heavily make use of *ink annotations* and *animations*. 

If you do not have PowerPoint installed, you can view them online *(for free, and on any platform)* using [PowerPoint online](https://office.live.com/start/PowerPoint.aspx
). Alternatively, you can upload the slides to your SkyDrive account and view them through there.

Unfortunately, LibreOffice does not display ink annotations correctly. A PDF is available as well - animations were split in separate slides using [PPSpliT](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~rimondin/downloads.php).
